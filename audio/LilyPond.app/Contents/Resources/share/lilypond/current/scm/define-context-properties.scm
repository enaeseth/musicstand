@item symbol
The symbol is the name of the context in which the following rules are to be
applied. For example, if @var{context} is @rinternals{Score} then all
staves share accidentals, and if @var{context} is @rinternals{Staff} then
all voices in the same staff share accidentals, but staves do not.

@item procedure
The procedure represents an accidental rule to be applied to the previously
specified context.

The procedure takes the following arguments:

@table @code

@item context
The current context to which the rule should be applied.

@item pitch
The pitch of the note to be evaluated.

@item barnum
The current bar number.

@item measurepos
The current measure position.
